# Checkers-Simulation

This project is made for the "Jugend Forscht" competition.

Goal is to program a versatile platform to test and compare different algorithms against one another by letting them play checkers.

In the finished program you will be able to add your one checkers playing algorithm as a module written in java or c++.
